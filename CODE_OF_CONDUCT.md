# Code of Conduct

# Summary

This is an 18+ instance for people who are into hyper, multi, etc. to use how they please. If you want to use this as your daily driver main account, go for it. If you want to only post art, that's fine!

All we ask is that you be respectful to your fellow unusual citizens, and to the Fediverse at large. A lot of these rules are just to try to codify that in as clear of terms as possible.

For quick reference on how to report bad behavior or request a content takedown, see the *Disallowed Posted Content* section.

# Rules

## Account Policies

### Profile Content

 - Profile avatars, banners, or bios may not be NSFW, as this information cannot be content-warned.
 - Profiles that post NSFW content must have an 18+ warning
     - Example: using the :over18: emoji or writing “18+” somewhere in the profile (in the name or bio)
### Bots

 - Bot accounts must be marked as a bot in Settings → Profile → Mark this account as a bot

## **Add Content Warnings (CW)**

*To add a Content Warning:*

Click the “Hide Content” button at the bottom of the post field (oval with a slash through it), then type a Content Warning into the “Comments” field above your post. It can be short, something like “Lewd hyper multi furry”. Use any and all applicable warnings/tags.

*To set your media to be NSFW by default:*

Go to Settings → Drive → Mark as NSFW by default.

Here are the kinds of content you must add a content warning for:

### NSFW

 - Posts containing any form of NSFW content should be CW’d as such.
 - NSFW posts of IRL content must also have an “IRL” CW.
### Potentially Controversial Topics

 - Posts containing potentially controversial topics such as, but not limited to: politics and religion, should be CW’d with the corresponding topic.
 - E.g. a political post should be tagged with “politics”.
### Spoilers 

 - Posts containing spoilers of recently released media (movies, games, etc.) must be CW’d with the title of the media followed by “spoilers”.
### Crossposts from Other Sites

 - Posts that are entirely content from another site must be CW’d as “crosspost”, including the name of the source.
### AI Content

 - Posts that contain AI generated content (e.g. image, stories, text, etc.) must be CW’d as such.
### Upsetting Content

 - Vent / rant posts, talk of suicide, death, major illness, must be CW’d as such.

## **Disallowed Posted Content**

*To report a post or an account:*

Use the “Report” button under the three-dots “More” icon on any post or account to report it to moderation staff. Please include a short description of why the content is objectionable.

*To request a takedown of content:*

If someone has posted content you want removed, for example IRL or fictional content that you did not consent to being posted, you can request a takedown. If you have an account, you can report the post in question (see above) or you can email `admin@hyper.equipment`  with a link to the post and a short description of why the content should be taken down.

The following categories of content are not allowed to be posted from any account, including bot accounts.

### Cub

 - Any character below legal age in the server’s hosted location (United States, 18 y.o.) is not allowed. Since it’s not always possible to know with fictional canon characters (Rule 34) they are allowed if their age is unknown and they look to be appropriately of age.
### Illegal IRL Content

 - Illegal IRL content such as zoophilia, underage, rape, etc. is strictly forbidden.
### Uncredited Art Posts

 - Ideally, link directly to the artist’s preferred profile using Markdown syntax. If you don’t know, try using a service like Foxbot on Telegram to find out. If you can’t find it, tag with “unknown artist”.
 - Claiming someone else’s art as your own is strictly forbidden.
### Hateful Content

 - Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise discriminatory content is forbidden.
### NFTs / Crypto Shilling

 - Attempting to sell or solicit crypto, or push others into buying or trading crypto, or advertising joining a crypto group, is forbidden.
 - All of the previous statement also goes for NFTs. Profile pictures using a hexagonal shape to attempt to appear like an NFT will not incur admin action, but will probably not get a warm reception.
 - You may list personal crypto wallet addresses, for example in the context of receiving donations or tips for a publicly available service.
### Personal / Private Information of Others

 - Posting information about someone is forbidden as long as it is not publicly listed, such as:
     - real name, sex, physical, email, or IP address, phone number
     - location in any finer detail than state, country or timezone, including postal code
     - specific age (e.g. “forties” is fine, but “forty-seven” is not)
     - profiles on any other service like Telegram, Discord, Signal, Steam
### Spam

 - Do not repeatedly post the same thing or send multiple extremely short posts within a short time period.
 - Do not advertise without any other content.
     - e.g. you can mention a service you like and offer your opinion about it, or an anecdote regarding it, but an impersonal ad paste is not allowed.

## Respectful Conduct

This section doesn't have hard rules because it's difficult to define what respectful conduct is. We don't want to restrict people by being overly prescriptive, and expect that anyone joining this instance is mature enough to handle themselves with perhaps some minor guidance. So in short:

You can talk politics, complain about other websites, or moan about the DMV all you want. Don't attack people. This includes in a disagreement or argument with someone; you are expected to disagree without a fight or disengage if a conversation is not productive.
